                    This is how the story of 'one' starts. He lived his life without questioning anything and he lived his life happily, never wondering what could be beyond the hills.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="two" class="tab-pane fade">
            <h3>two</h3>
                <p> 
                    'two' was different. He popped in and out of 'one's world, never seeming to stay in one place in their eyes. But that was natural for 'two'. He couldn't help but live his life on his own terms. Others crucified 'two' for his free spirited ways, but 'two' didn't mind.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="three" class="tab-pane fade">
            <h3>three</h3>
                <p> 
                    'three' was an onlooker of sorts. No one knew about 'three' but three knew about everyone. He could SEE everything. He even knew about how boring 'one's life was and how different 'two' was compared to everone else is 'one's world.
